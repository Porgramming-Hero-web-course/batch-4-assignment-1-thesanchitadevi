## The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.
Union and intersection types are powerful tools in TypeScript that allow you to create more flexible and expressive type definitions.

### Union Type
A **union type** represents a value that can be one of several types. It is defined using the pipe ```(|)``` operator.

```
type StringOrNumber = string | number;

let value: StringOrNumber = "hello"; // Valid
value = 42; // Also valid
```
In this example, ``value`` can be either a string or a number.

### Intersection Type
An **intersection type** represents a value that must be combines multiple types into one. It is defined using the ampersand ```(&)``` operator.

```
interface IPerson {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface IAddress {
  street: string;
  city: string;
}

type PersonWithAddress = IPerson & IAddress;

const person: PersonWithAddress = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  street: "123 Main St",
  city: "New York",
};
```
In this example, ``PersonWithAddress`` requires both ``name``, ``age``, ``street``, and ``city`` properties.

## The significance of both these types -
* Allow for more precise type checking
* Enable more reusable code
* Make code easier to understand and maintain
* Reduce Runtime Errors
